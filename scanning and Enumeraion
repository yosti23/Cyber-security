### what is scanning ?
^scanning is the 2nd phase Ethical Hacking .
^ it is the step which help to test a system based on the information      we gathered .
^ scanning is another essential step,which is necssary and it refers to the package of techniques or proceduer used to identify hosts,ports and various services within asystem.

## Why do we do scanning?


- It helps to Identify HOST’s System detail
    - Operation System
     - Service versions
- To Discover Open Ports
- To Discover Live Systems
## Network Scanning
- his is a method of Scanning a network and getting more informations.
    
- There are Many kinds of scanning methods and tools for different purpose.
- For Network mainly: NMAP,netdiscovery
- For Subdomain: Sublist3r,subfinder,amass
- For website: Nuclei , Nessus, Acunitix.
   ####  Nmap - Network Mapper
- Nmap is A network scanning and exploring tool used by network and security experts.
    
- It is used to scan Network,Ports,OS,...
    
- It is made for windows and linux
    
- ON kali linux it is built in.
    
- To check the existence of nmap on your system
         - nmap --version

### Live System Discovery
    

- Discovering live system means, Checking up and running hosts(clients/servers) on a network.
    
- We have seen Host checking last time with ping  sweep method.(getting ip with link)
    
-     But How does the ping worked
### ping sweep

- This is a method of checking if host is up or down.
    
- It uses ICMP(Internet Control Message Protocol)

- packets for checking purpose
    
- It sends Echo request and waits for response if there is Echo reply then that system is up!
 This is my ubuntu server and the ip is “ 192.168.56.101  “

## demo  
Let’s Check if my ubuntu server is UP! With ping sweep

- From echo requests we can gather the following informations
    

- OS type
   - Windows ( 32 byte  )
   - ttl=108
   - Linux ( 64 byte )
   - ttl=64
    

- Connection stability
- Time 
Ttl : time to live

### Nmap ping sweep

- Nmap can perform ping sweep too.
- Syntax: 
- nmap -sn IP                   -sn = no port scan

- -> What do we do ,to know all the hosts on our system?
    
-  ping can take 1 host only??
    
- Nmap can scan the whole range.
    
- Guess how?
    
- You can do the ping sweep with little modification on the IP
    
- Syntax:
- nmap -sn GatewayIP-255
- nmap -sn GatewayIP/networkBits(subnet mask) - CIDR notation
    
   
    - Network bits depend on the IP Class.
    

- This will not work on Virtual machines network.

### What is PORT?
- Port is process-specific or an application-specific software construct serving as a communication endpoint, which is used by the Transport Layer protocols of Internet Protocol suite, such as User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
    
- It is like a door for some purpose/service
    
- Example: if you want to get in to your house by which method do u get it?
    

- BY DOOR
    

- Here there are different objects to get in, if wind is wanted in the house we might use windows.
    
- So here in there scenario
    

- Windows are for winds
    
- Doors are for human
    

- These are ports those can help u to get it.

Also you home can have different doors and the main gate in your bedroom can be number 1 ,the salon door is number 2….
On computer there are different 65,536 ports with different job(like the window and door)

- 1-1024 = reserved(well known) ports

Example: 

- HTTP(80) - unsecured Web port
    
- HTTPS(443) - secured web port
    
- FTP(21) - File transfering port
    
- SSH(22) - Secured shell port

### Port status
Ports can be on different status

- Open ports

    -  THESE are ports open for accepting any requests.

    - Having an open window can lead to any kind of gas(ጭስ) or air getting to our house.
    

- Closed ports
    

   - THESE are ports which are not accepting any request but there is some service running on it.
 
   - Ex: Having your home door close. 
    

          - still the door helps sometime, but not for now
    

- Filtered ports
    

      - These are ports which nmap is not sure of being open or closed.
    

## Open port discovery


On some system ports can be open for some purpose

Example: anywhere when you access websites there is web port open(80,443), 
If you are getting some shell activity there is port 22 open
- there problem, is there are some ports open without intention, this leads to attack

- We can use nmap to check which port is open/closed
    
- And this is called port discovery
    
- Syntax:

       - nmap IP    =>    only the 1000 ports
    
      - nmap -p port 1,port2,port3 IP     =>    only    port 1,2,3
    
      - nmap -p- IP     =>  All the 65K port
    
## Scanning methods


Nmap scans network in different modes

1. TCP connect (TCP scan)
    
2. TCP SYN (Stealth scan)
    
3. UDP scan
    
4. Xmas scan


## TCP Scan

- As we saw last time TCP is the best on doing connection oriented Things. 
    
- it is reliable But how?
    
- This is Because it uses 3-way HANDSHAKE!!!
    
- What is 3-way handshake?
## 3way handshake**
    
**- When you establish a TCP connections there is something going behind the scenes
    
- What was the packet sent while the Ping sweep, it was the ICMP
- Here When we start connection we will send a Synchronization flag.
    
- When the server got and accepted our request it will reply with Synchronization and Acknowledgment.
    
- Finally, we will send Acknowledgement or Reset(RST) and continue because we have connection/network now.
It is like meeting someone.

1. You: hi.
    
2. They:  hello
    
3. You: Nice to meet you..
    
## Stealth Scan
- This is TCP scan but here we dont send the last ACK flag.
    
- But we send the RESET flag.
    
- Syntax: 
    

- sudo nmap -sS IP

### Xmas Scan


- Here, The 1st thing to send is FIN/PSH/URG instead of SYN.
    
- If there is response like RST flag Then the system is close
    
- If there is no response the system is open.
    
- Syntax:
- sudo nmap -sX IP
## Operating System Detection

**- Nmap have a feature to detect the operating system of the host.
    
- Syntax:
- sudo nmap -O IP => OS detection only
    
- sudo nmap -A IP     => OS detection including version**
## Scan Speeds


- When nmap do its scan, it have a time waiting, after sending 1 packets to a host.
    
- There are 5 time waitings.
    
- The nmap time template is -T<0-5>
    

- Insane -T5
    
- Aggressive -T4
    
- Normal -T3
    
- Polite -T2
    
- Sneaky -T1
