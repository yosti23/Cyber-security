## What is Malware
- A Malware is a set of instructions(program) that run on your computer and make your system do something that an attacker wants it to do.
    
- The name Malware Come from
    - Malicious => ተንኮለኛ(bad thing)
    - Software => set of instruction(program)
    - Mal - ware**

#### TROJAN!


- Trojan, is a type of malicious code or software that looks legitimate but can take control of your computer. 
    
- A Trojan is designed to damage, disrupt, steal, or in general inflict some other harmful action on your data or network.
    
- They don’t replicate.
    
- The name Trojan came from the Greek mythology Trojan Horse.
    
- Trojans will looks normal or legit software and then BOOM!
    
## Greek Mythology
- There was war between 2 countries and the winning country, send gift to the losing country the gift was huge wood house. But inside it there were soldiers and the soldiers came out at night and evade the city.
#### Common types of trojan
1. Backdoor Trojan

    A. This Trojan can create a “የጀርባ በር” on your computer. It lets an attacker access your computer and control it. Your data can be downloaded by a third party and stolen. Or more malware can be uploaded to your device.
    

2. Mailfinder Trojan
    

    A. This Trojan seeks to steal the email addresses you’ve accumulated on your device.
    
3. Remote Access Trojan
    

    A. This Trojan can give an attacker full control over your computer via a remote network connection. Its uses include stealing your information or spying on you.
    
    1. C2 Servers(Command and Control): This is just the server which the malware communicate with, to pass commands to the malware also to have control over the malware to send and receive data.
    

4. Trojan banker
    

    A. This Trojan takes aim at your financial accounts. It’s designed to steal your account information for all the things you do online. That includes banking, credit card, and bill pay data.
#### Worm

- A computer worm can propagate or self-replicate from one computer to another without human interaction after breaching a system. 
    
- Typically, a worm spreads across a network through your Internet or LAN (Local Area Network) connection.
    
- Damages files on the system and the system
    

#### Virus
- They are the older and famous ones
    
- Virus is a program written to enter to your computer and damage/alter your files/data. 
    
- A virus might corrupt or delete data on your computer. 
    
- Viruses can also replicate themselves. 
    
- A computer Virus is more dangerous makes changes or deletes your files**
#### Common signs of virus infection
- Speed of System
    
- Pop-up windows
    
- Self-executing
    
- Account being log out
    
- Crashing of device
    
- Mass emails being sent from you
    
- Files and system settings are altered.

##### Common types of virus

There are several types of computer viruses that can infect devices.

1. Resident Virus
    

      A. Viruses propagate themselves by infecting applications on a host computer. A resident virus achieves this by infecting applications as they are opened by a user.
    

       A non-resident virus is capable of infecting executable files when programs are not running.
    

2. Multipartite Virus
    

      A. A multipartite virus uses multiple methods to infect and spread across computers. It will typically remain in the computer’s memory to infect the hard disk, then spread through and infect more drives by altering the content of applications. This results in performance lag and application memory running low. 
    

3. Browser Hijacker
    

     A. A browser hijacker manually changes the settings of web browsers, such as replacing the homepage, editing the new tab page, and changing the default search engine. Technically, it is not a virus because it cannot infect file.
#### Ransomware

- Ransomware is malware that employs encryption to hold a victim’s information at ransom. 
- A user or organization’s critical data is encrypted so that they cannot access files, databases, or applications

- A ransom is then demanded to provide access.
    
- Ransomware is often designed to spread across a network and target database and file servers, and can thus quickly paralyze an entire organization.
    

- Ransomware =>   RANSOM    +     SOFTWAR



#### Rootkit
- A rootkit is a malicious software bundle designed to give unauthorized access to a computer or other software. 
    
- Rootkits are hard to detect and can conceal their presence within an infected system. 
    
- Hackers use rootkit malware to remotely access your computer, manipulate it, and steal data.
    

#### Adware

- Adware, or advertising supported software, is software that displays unwanted advertisements on your computer.
    
-  Adware programs will tend to serve you pop-up ads, can change your browser's homepage, add spyware and just bombard your device with advertisements.

##### How do they infect?
- USB drop attack ( infected removable drives )
- Spam emails
- Malicious Office macros
- Softwares/Applications from unsafe websites.
- Torrent sites
- Using Cracked Softwares
- Malicious Browser extension
##### How they are hidden/undetected

Hackers use different methods to pass some protections and infect that system.

1. Packers
    

        A. A packer is a program that compresses an executable to make it smaller. It wraps the compressed executable in the code necessary to decompress itself at runtime. Packing changes this the binary patterns and some hashes(day5) , so the AV may not detect the packed file.
    
2. Crypters/encoders
    

        A. A crypter is similar to a packer but adds additional obfuscation or encryption to the mix. Like a packer, its goal is to change the binary fingerprint of a file to avoid detection. In a nutshell, the crypter encrypts the original executable using an encryption algorithm — often something as simple as a [XOR cipher](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/xor-cipher/) with a unique key.
    

3. Polymorphic Malware
    

        A. At the highest level, polymorphic malware is malware that repeatedly uses packing and crypting methods to change the way it looks.
    

4. Downloaders, Droppers, and Staged Loading
    

        A. Many kinds of malware use staging programs called droppers or downloaders to learn about a system before installing the real malware. Some of these droppers scope out a system first to avoid triggering security alerts when they download and install the real payload.
    
##### Malware Prevention
1. Install anti-virus and anti-spyware software.
    
        A. Example: kaspersky,avg,smadav
    
2. Use secure authentication methods.
    

          A. 2-factor authentication
    
          B. Implement email security and spam protection
    

3. Keep software updated
    
4. Use the least-privilege model.
    
5. Monitor for suspicious activity
    
6. Educate your users
    

##### Malware in history

****

Lets see some malwares happened in history:

1. Morris Worm: Also known as the Internet worm, this was one of the first computer worms to spread via the Internet and earn notoriety in the media.
    
2. ILOVEYOU: The ILOVEYOU virus infected tens of millions of computers globally, resulting in billions of dollars in damage.
    
3. Stuxnet: Some experts believe this sophisticated worm was developed for years to launch a cyberattack.
    
4. WannaCry: is a ransomware which targeted computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system by encrypting (locking) data and demanding ransom payments in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency.

##### Python for Malware development

- As we saw malwares do so many things and we can develop that malware based on the algorithm, We need. 
    
- First we have to understand what our malware have to do.
    
- There are so many kinds of malware purpose
             - Delete files
             - Encrypt files
             - Corrupt files
    
    

- Then You can Convert your python file to executable(exe) by py2exe technics

#### Malware Analysis

****

- Malware analysis is a process of analyzing malwares
    
- When a system is infected with malwares , Security testers will do analysis on that malware.
    
- But 1st then will hold the malware as sample it is called artifact
    
- Then They will do the analysis 
    
- There are 2 types of analysis
    

1. Static Analysis: Analyzing the virus, by just seeing the byte codes and the meta datas.
    
2. Dynamic Analysis: is a process of analyzing the virus by running the malware in Sandbox/virtual machine. Then understanding the malware behaviour
